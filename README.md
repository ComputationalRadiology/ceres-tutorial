# ceres-tutorial
This code provides an example of working with the numerical solver
library from Google called ceres. More information about Ceres is available here: http://ceres-solver.org/

This code builds a container from Ubuntu 24.04, and exercises the Ceres
solver through a Cython interface to python 3.12.
